# Coding Quiz

You should follow these steps exactly as you set up your repo. Failure to do so will result in a compilation 
error when you submit your code.

1. Clone the Repo
2. When you get your question from Autolab, right-click the "quiz" package, hover over "New" and click "Java Class"
3. For each question, type in the exact name of the class as specified in Autolab (case-sensitive. ClassName != classname).

Partial credit is available, however, to receive any credit for a question your code must compile and include all of the required methods.
If you wish to get credit for any method(s) you completed but have not completed the remaining methods, you should write the method header and
if needed return some fixed value. This will allow the tests for the question to compile and credit to be awarded.

You have a test package containing a class named QuizTest. You may write whatever unit tests you wish in this 
class, but they will not be considered by the autograder and are completely optional. If you choose to write them,
keep in mind that your tests will not be checked for correctness.
